# Autobot Library

Autobot Library is a modular and efficient Arduino library designed to simplify mobile robot development. It abstracts complex kinematics for various drive types and provides builtin communication handlers for remote control via WiFi (UDP) or AI coprocessors (Raspberry Pi/Jetson).



## Requirements

### 1. Arduino (Basic Control)
Hardware and software required for basic robot movement (without AI).

#### Hardware
* **Microcontroller:** ESP32 Development Board (Recommended for `HardwareSerial` support).
* **Motor Driver:** PWM-compatible driver (e.g., L298N, TB6612FNG).
    * 2/4 Channels for Differential Drive.
    * 4 Channels for Mecanum/Omni Drive.
* **Motors:** DC Motors (2 or 4 units depending on drive type).
* **Power Supply:** Li-ion Battery (2S or 3S) suitable for your motors.

#### Software
* **Arduino IDE:** Latest version.
* **Library:** `ArduinoRobot.h` (Must be included in your project folder).

### 2. Arduino + Raspberry Pi (AI & Vision)
Additional requirements for Human Tracking and Line Tracking features.

#### Hardware
* **SBC:** Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (Recommended for YOLOv8 performance).
* **Camera:** USB Webcam or Raspberry Pi Camera.
* **Connection:** 3x Jumper wires for UART communication (RX, TX, GND).

#### Wiring (ESP32 to Raspberry Pi)

Connect the ESP32 to the Raspberry Pi GPIO headers as follows:

| Signal | ESP32 Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RX** | Pin 16 | GPIO 14 (TXD) |
| **TX** | Pin 17 | GPIO 15 (RXD) |
| **GND** | GND | GND |
